                    <div class="w2-text">Here at ZNK Consultancy we have built a network of banks who are friendly, and approachable when it comes to working with Payment Institutions and Electronic Money Institutions in providing clients safeguarding accounts. <BR> <BR>
Having a good understanding of each partner bankâ€™s risk appetite and product offering enables us to find the most suitable options for our clients seeking to segregate client funds into a safeguarding account. <BR> <BR>
Banks have their own criteria and fee structure,  some of our partner banks stipulate that PIs and EMIs must hold a minimum balance in their account. The fees that the banks charge will also vary, ranging from hundred pounds or euros per month to a thousand or more pounds per month, some banks will charge a fee to carry out their due diligence on the company and its shareholders but then charge a relatively low flat monthly fee or a one off fee and some will not charge.
